Code written by Graham W Smith for the Flipboard coding challenge for Summer 2016

Compile with:
javac -cp \* MazeSolver.java

Run with:
java -cp .:\* MazeSolver

These commands worked for me on Ubuntu and should work in any Unix terminal.
Aparrently in Windows you should replace the : with ;
The commands require you to be in the same directory as the .java, (.class), and both .jar files.

I wrote the code as an Eclipse project originally, so if you'd rather have that package, I can send that over.

See samplesolutions.txt for the requested 3 sample solutions.
